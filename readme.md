What is MD-CMS?
================

MD-CMS is a CMS-framework.

MD-CMS is a basic and "less-assumption" CMS with some default features such as user authorization (including third party authentication),
menu, module and theme management.
It is fully customizable and extensible, you can make your own module and your own themes.
It provide freedom to make your very own CMS, which is not provided very well by any other CMS.

Who is it for?
--------------
MD-CMS will be good for you if you say yes for majority of these statement:

* You are a web developer who use CodeIgniter framework.
* You are tired of building the same things such an authorization-authentication for every project.
* You find that some part of your old project can be used for your next project.
* You are happy with CodeIgniter but you think some plug-ins and features should be provided by default.
* You want a simple and easy to learn framework that has 100% compatibility with CodeIgniter.
* You don't want to learn too many new terms.
* You are familiar with HMVC plugins, and you think it is one of "should be exists" feature in CodeIgniter.
* You are in tight deadline, at least you need to provide the prototype to your client.

Contributing
============

I made MD-CMS, but you can make it better. There are many way you can do to make MD-CMS better:

- __Donate few amount of money:__ I make MD-CMS freely available, but electricity, food, and internet access is not provided for free. I need them to keep alive so that I can continue the development of MD-CMS. I also need to invest several time to develop, debug, and add features to MD-CMS. If MD-CMS help you to save your time and money, please consider to click this cute yellow button, and keep MD-CMS's development: [![Donate](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donate_LG.gif)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=YDES6RTA9QJQL)

- __Bug report:__ I usually check and test my code carefully before publish it on github. However I am just a mere mortal, and can do mistakes. Whenever you see any unexpected behavior when using MD-CMS, you can always open an issue on github, make a post on MD-CMS forum, or email me directly. This will not only help you, but also help everyone using MD-CMS for their projects (including me)

- __Code contribution:__ Sometime I make mistakes, and to make it worse, sometime I do not even know how to fix those mistakes (It is a rare case however). If you are also a PHP coder, and you know how to fix things or make things better, just submit an issue or [Pull Request](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/) on the [__development branch of MD-CMS repository__](https://github.com/goFrendiAsgard/MD-CMS/tree/development) on GitHub.

- __Improve user guide:__ I am not a native English speaker. Sometime I also find dificulty to explain things. If you think you can improve MD-CMS's user guide, please have a visit [here](https://github.com/goFrendiAsgard/MD-CMS/blob/development/doc/tutorial.md) and edit things.

- __Translation:__ I know several programming languages, but human natural languages is much more harder to learn. If you want your native language to be available in MD-CMS, please do some translation and submit a pull request on github. However, if github scare you, do not worry. Just email me directly.

- __Tell your friends:__ If you think MD-CMS is great, tell your friend. With more users & contributors, MD-CMS will surely become better since there will be many people test it on different environments.
